Target machine will have http running so:
IP of target = 192.168.1.130

Load ip in web browser

Test for XSS Vulnerabilites
input <script>alert()</script> into text inputs
Search bar on home - fail
about us Name - success (input a vaguely reasonable email like j@j.com)
support message box - partial success 
(text on screen lacks the script tags suggesting that they aren't escaped and are instead removed)
suggests basic attempt at find and replace script tags
Try: <sc<script>ript>alert()</sc</script>ript> - success (when the string <script> and </script> get replaced it leaves behing a complete script tag)
